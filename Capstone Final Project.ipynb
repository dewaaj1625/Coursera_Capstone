    "Portland Oregon is home to over 50 craft breweries in the city and 84 total in the metro area, approximately 9 breweries per 50,000 people. That is a lot of breweries. How do you know which brewery to visit? What if you want to visit a few breweries and not worry about driving? An eco friendly, net-zero carbon brewery tasting shuttle bike tour is the answer!\n",
    "The tasting shuttle bike tour will guide guests throughout the neighborhood of choice stopping at 5 breweries allowing guests to try a sample flight at each brewery. \n",
    "This study will analyze the neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon to determine the best areas to open up a brewery tasting tour shuttle. Craft breweries are a very popular tourist attraction and at an all time high in popularity in the USA. People from all over the spectrum gather at breweries to indulge, relax, and create a welcoming community. Millenials, to Gen Z, and even baby boomers enjoy craft beer and would use a service like the shuttle bike. "

The venue info like popularity and ratings will help to determine the best spots to open a shuttle bike tour. Location of the breweries in the neighborhoods will be clustered based on k nearest neighbor algorithm. The brewery clusters do not have to contain breweries all from the same neighborhood. There could be 2 breweries next to each other but in different neighborhoods so it would not make sense to put them in separate tours. Each brewery cluster will be a tour offered by the company. "
